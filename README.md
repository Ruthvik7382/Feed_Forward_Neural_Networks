# Feed_Forward_Neural_Networks
This is my first neural network implementation for binary and multi-class classification
Setup and Data Generation: The code begins with importing necessary libraries and generating data using make_blobs for classification tasks.

Feedforward Network Implementation: It includes the implementation of a simple feedforward neural network with weight and bias initialization, sigmoid activation function, forward pass computation, and gradient descent for weight and bias updates.

Training and Visualization: The network is trained on the generated data, and loss over epochs is visualized. Additionally, weight changes and decision boundaries are visualized to understand the model's learning process.

Multiclass Classification: The notebook extends to implementing a feedforward neural network for multiclass classification, including one-hot encoding of labels and modifying the network to handle multiple outputs.

Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated in terms of training and validation accuracy.
